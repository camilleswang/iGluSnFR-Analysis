Instructions to fill the Excel template:

tini		time of first stimulation (AP) for low freq. stimulation (for single vesicle analysis)
Nstim		number of AP.
tinterval	interval, in seconds, between AP.
tpeak1		high frequency stimulation (for fitting of "big peaks" in Matlab script).
tpeak2,3...	use these if you did multiple high frequency stimualtion or high potassium, always write the end time of a peak (e.g. tpeak2) by filling the next peak time (e.g. tpeak3 will be the end time for tpeak2, if you don't write a value for tpeak3 the script will not analyze tpeak2).
Total_points	number of values to save all the single vesicle fusion events found in a separate matrix -dF- (i.e. the number of points after the peak that you want to save in order to plot it later or do whatever you want).
Amplitude_limit	here write the limit in amplitude to discard multivesicular fusion events.
increment	here write the interval between on frama and the next in seconds (i.e. the inverse of you imaging speed).
min_fit_points	the minimum number or values required to fit the decay of the single vesicle fusion events.

Time (s)	time column.
Whole picture	the fluorescence of the whole field of view, you can leave it blank if you want.
Frame number	frame number, you can leave it blank if you want.
Roi1,ROI2...	fluorescence traces for each ROI.

You can copy all this information from the metadata of your imaging experiment. 

Fill one sheet per imaging experiment, the script will loop through all the sheets and save the results with the corresponding sheet number.
